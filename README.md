# PyAero

A Python package to design, manipulate and optimize Airfoils. This package contains matplotlib interface to select constraint points to optimise the airfoil and a python interface to 2D pannel solvers XFOIL.

The package will use genetic algorithm heuristic search methods to optimze the airfoil geometry based on  given constraints.
